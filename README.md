# Goli Action Helper

![Goli](img/GOLI.jpg)

## Get started
This program was implemented in order to have a kind of deployment adapted to people with a server that is not in an **Azure**, **AWS** etc. environment.

It is a very simple REST-API implemented in the **Go** language, which allows to perform actions in a server from a simple request.

## What do you need to have before using this program (prerequisites)?
You need to have a server and have ubuntu running on it.

## Configure your server to use Goli

### Create Domain for Goli


### Create a GitHub personal access token
![Follow this link](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)

- Select the __read:packages__ scope to download container images and read their metadata.
- Select the __write:packages__ scope to download and upload container images and read and write their metadata.

### Run the setup script
```
chmod +x ./setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```

After this your "Goli Action Helper" is ready for use. Enjoy ;-)
